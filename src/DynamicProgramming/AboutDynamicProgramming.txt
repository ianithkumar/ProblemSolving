* Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub problems and
solving each sub problem just once, storing its solution for future reference. It is particularly useful for optimization
problems where overlapping sub problems occur. There are two main types of DP:

* In the top-down approach, the problem is solved recursively and solutions to sub problems are stored to
avoid redundant calculations.

* In the Bottom-up approach, smaller sub problems are solved first and their solutions are
used to build up solutions to larger problems.

* DP is commonly used in problems involving sequences, such as the Fibonacci sequence, shortest path algorithms,
and knapsack problems, where it optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary re-computation.
